# Linux Debugger

A simple Linux debugger, mainly for me to learn more about ELF / DWARF on Linux. Who knows if this will ever be a usable application.

TODO:
  * Add commands to retrieve registers and data to front end
  * Print data/registers using PrintData (fix string printing)
  * Add attach command line to attach to running process
  * Add command line history support (up to 50 unique history commands?)
  * If enter pressed with no text entered, run last command in history
